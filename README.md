# Flappy Bird

Flappy bird is a popular arcade game where the user has to click a button which make the bird "jump" the bird must fly through a series of pipes, each pipe
having a small gap for the bird to fly through. In this code, I have replicated the game Flappy Bird.

# Street Fighter

Street Fighter is also a very popular arcade game in which two players fight each other through two characters. The characters can punch and kick each other, along with using special moves. When a player runs out of health, he dies. In this code, I recreated Street Fighter without the special moves. So I created a game where two players can fight each other through punching and kicking.

# The codes
 
Unfortunately, you will now be able to run the codes on here since I downloaded a library to complete these projects. A library is a set imports or prewritten code to help optimize their programmer's tasks.
